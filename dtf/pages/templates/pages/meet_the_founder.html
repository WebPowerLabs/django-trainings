<p class="question">Jami, why did you start DTF?</p>

<p class="response">It is plain and simple, mentorship and applied success principles changed my life for the best. I would not be where I am today spiritually, emotionally, financially, or even relationally had it not been for the people who shared their wisdom and knowledge with me. It was their hindsight that became my foresight and it accelerated the learning curve in all areas of my life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="response">I want other women who know they have something great inside. If they get the support they need, it is possible to have a life filled with fun, freedom and peace.</p>
</blockquote>

	<p class="response">You may not even know what your gift or calling is yet, or maybe you are not sure how to express it to the world yet, but as you become more self aware and learn how to self govern, life translates into a really fabulous and fun experience more days than not because you are passionately pursuing your purpose. </p>

	<p class="response">I get goose bumps when I think about all that is available to you when you “get it”. I absolutely love my life, and it certainly wasn’t that way for a really long time. The low membership price is a reflection of our commitment to share what we know with everyone who wants to have it for themselves. </p>

	<p class="question">Why is it not free if you want everyone to have the knowledge you are sharing?</p> 

	<p class="response">Because people often do not value what is free. I learned early on that my commitment to the process of transformation was equivalent to the investment I made. That includes time as well as money. I hope the investment isn't too low quite honestly. There is so much value inside this community, however, we want to leave no one behind. The world needs you now! </p>

	<p class="question">Where do you get your inspiration from?</p> 

	<p class="response">I have put personal growth and development at the top of my list for over 20 years. I dine on it daily. When we are conditioned to see what opportunities others can’t see, and hear what others can’t hear, the whole world of potential and possibility is open for us in which we can participate. At the point your eyes and ears become aware to what Wallace Wattles refers to as Infinite Substance ( thought inspired by God), it then becomes a matter of choice between whether or not we become successful in fulfilling our destiny. At that point, the journey becomes very exciting! I can hardly wait to get up in the morning and I go to bed really late sometimes because I want to experience so much more from the day. Don’t get me wrong, I have a 30 second commute to my office with a beautiful view. Having the freedom and flexibility to do what I want, when I want, and where I want, is inspiring too. I truly squeeze every ounce of life out of every second of it. </p>

	<p class="question">Is there anything else?</p> 

	<p class="response">I absolutely cannot neglect telling you that my conversations with God are by far the most inspiring moments. I am in constant communication with Him, not audibly of course unless you happen to be in my car and see me pleading with or yelling ( yes, I have done that) at Him sometimes. Man is He patient with this child. But truly, I find myself in situations that only He could have orchestrated. I believe that He wants authentic communication and a real relationship with everyone, all we have to do is ask. </p>

	<p class="question">What is your faith exactly?</p> 

	<p class="response">Coming to a decision to follow Christ is a very personal moment for me. I am happy to share with anyone who would like to know about that. My true guidance comes from the Bible which I believe is the inspired Word of God. When I let go and gave in to the powerful tug on my heart to just believe in the work at the cross, I felt like I literally had a veil lift from my eyes and could make sense of the message that is for God’s people. It is grace and love and kindness and mercy that adopts us into His family because of Jesus Christ. 
<blockquote>
	<p class="response">My life did not get instantly easy, and sometimes it still isn’t. Sometimes we get to feel the fire, sometimes we need the light of the fire to lead the way through the darkness. Jon Courson says that life can be a fabulous adventure or an endless route of detours, the difference in the experience is our faith. 
</blockquote>
	<p class="response">I could talk on and on about this. I am not hear to judge or convince. I respect every person for their own choices and simply ask they respect me as well. 

	<p class="question">So do you preach from the Bible in your community?</p> 

	<p class="response">Hmmm? I hope not!(laugh). I don’t really like it when people are telling me what is right and wrong. I want the dignity of discovering and deciding that for myself. How could I not offer that to someone else?</p> 

	<p class="response">Frankly, Truth is Truth no matter who speaks it. Who I am is very evident in the way I speak, in my community, in the grocery store, on the stage in front of hundreds of people. It is my truth. I want to live the best way that I can in every moment. My insides have to match my outside in order for anything I say to be truly authentic. Is there anything you would like to say? I want everyone to know I am on the same journey you are. I may be a little further down the path than some but there are plenty of people ahead of me. I remember a conversation that Oprah and Gail were having about success. Oprah said the higher you get on the success ladder, the lonelier it is because most people just aren’t ready to go on. I believe we have a choice, there is that word again, the choice is to get comfortable and someday slip backwards or keep going one little step at a time. I created the community so that more women would take those steps and have someone to encourage and equip them along the way. </p>

	<p class="response">I also want everyone to know that I have not arrived, I am not perfect. I fail and I succeed. But I have a passion for life that others say is infectious and if that is true then I hope you catch it because I am having a lot of fun figuring it out! </p>
